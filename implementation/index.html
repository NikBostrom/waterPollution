            <h2>Murky Waters</h2>
            From catastrophic oil spills in the Gulf to poisonous lead in the drinking water of Flint, this
            country has a growing water pollution problem. While some problems have simple solutions, others
            have much more complex, involved solutions that require precise, accurate, and quantifiable data.
            Many people concerned with the quality of water in the United States believe that a lack of funding
            is the biggest obstacle to cleaning up the waters, but data, and simultaneously a lack thereof,
            shows us that there is more to this problem than previously postured, and as we will see, this occurs
            most prevalently in the Midwest.

            <h2>EPA and Its Flaws</h2>
            The supposed stalwart of American environmental interests is the
            <a href="https://epa.gov" target="_blank">EPA</a>, the <strong>United States Environmental Protection Agency</strong>.
            Some of the most important tenets of its mission are to protect human health and to protect the
            environment. According to the EPA, it is responsible for studying environmental issues, as well
            as developing and enforcing environmental regulations, among other things.

            <h2>Make Room For Data</h2>
            <p>
                Most of us have heard that data, Big Data, data analytics, or any mixture of the three, are the way of the future. Data allows us to identify, quantify, analyze, and solve problems that we currently have, and it even has the potential to predict future trends and occurrences in the world. Although obvious, it must not go unsaid that data collection is crucially important to solving these environmental issues.
            </p>
            <p>
                Without data collection, we cannot be sure how a system or ecosystem is behaving, the status of its health, or what the direct cause of a problem may be. In terms of data collection and analysis, the EPA is not currently doing enough to give our waters the care and support that we need, and this has proven to be critical in allowing our bodies of water to remain polluted, most notably in the midwest as we will see.

            This map shows the different regions of the United States and their respective proportions of healthy, threatened, impaired, and unassessed waters, including lakes, rivers, and estuaries. We can see clearly in the midwestern regions that there are far too many unassessed waters. This means that we do not have any data for these bodies and are not able to monitor trends and ecosystem health.

            Prior to local industrial activity, the Chesapeake Bay was a strong, healthy estuary ecosystem. Nitrogen and phosphorus, according to the EPA, are natural parts of aquatic ecosystems.
            <blockquote> <em>“[Nitrogen and phosphorus] have increased to excessive levels over the last few decades. Prior to substantial human activity in the region, most nitrogen and phosphorus was absorbed or retained by natural forest and wetland vegetation. However, the activities of over 13.6 million people in the watershed have overwhelmed the Chesapeake Bay with excess amounts of nutrients.”</em></blockquote>

            <p>
                Excess amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus lead to a greatly increased population of algae in the ecosystem, which will decrease the oxygen available for the aquatic life and lead to large-scale fish kills, if unchecked. In this instance, the collection of water chemistry data allowed the involved organizations to find that there was a problem that arose specifically from the sheer amount of nitrogen and phosphorus in the water, and they were able to use those findings to pursue effective cleaning solutions.

                In 2009, President Barack Obama, having been made aware of this situation, signed an Executive Order enforcing stringent laws and remediation strategies surrounding the bay and its nutrient pollution. These actions, along with subsequent efforts from the environmental agencies involved, have caused significant health improvements for the estuary.

            <h2>Clean Water in Action</h2>
            Leading up to the passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972, the New York Harbor was made unswimmable by fecal pathogens and many other human-based pollutants. After collecting and sampling the water, the harbor was able to produce data showing that sewage contamination was the source of the pollution problem. We see in these visualizations the different concentrations of various contaminants being measured from the harbor, and how those concentrations change throughout the year on average.

            We see from these cases that simply collecting data has huge advantages, both in terms of human and of aquatic life, and in terms of maintaining healthy ecosystems. When the data is accurate and available, researchers and scientists are able to monitor, identify, and analyze problems that arise from our systems and ecosystems, as was the case with Chesapeake Bay and New York Harbor. In this visualization, we see how the collection of data from lakes across the country clearly alerts us that there is a problem with water quality in the midwestern states.

            An even bigger problem here lies outside of the data. This chart was created by water chemistry data

By not consistently monitoring and analyzing data before and after, the EPA has effectively opened the door for water pollution to grow larger in scale throughout the midwestern states, who already suffer from nutrient and other pollution.

                In <a href="http://netnebraska.org/article/news/water-woes-widespread-across-nebraska" target="_blank">this article from 2013</a>, 6 years after the publishing of the
                previously-mentioned dataset, we learn that park managers in Nebraska began using “expensive
                chemicals” around 2007 to combat invasive species, in the form of aerial spraying. The spraying
                began in 2007, and continued at least until the writing of this article. It was estimated at that
                time that more than $1 million per year would be allocated for this spraying to take place and
                combat the invasive plant species. The species are said to “choke” the water of its nutrients.

            <p>
                Had the EPA been consistently tracking data on the national bodies of water, we might have seen that
                the nitrogen levels of these bodies of water have increased exponentially after these sprayings, and
                that is without mentioning the impact of humans and industries being situated nearby and having
                nitrogen-based runoff and fertilizer, which likely contributed to the accumulation of water
                pollution in the beginning.

            <p>
                We do not have information on the current state of Nebraska’s bodies of water, nor of the rest
                of the midwest, nor of the rest of the country. This is the biggest problem that we face with
                respect to our pursuit of water quality in the midwest, and the United States as a whole.
                When we have concrete data and can understand the state of a system, we are able to enact
                effective policy, such as President Obama did in 2009 and as we saw from the Clean Water
                Act of 1972, to create and maintain the health of our waters

            </p>
            <p>
                We need more data on those bodies of water if we are going to begin to solve the nation’s
                water quality challenges, and it starts with the EPA.
