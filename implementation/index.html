                    Nitrogen and phosphorus are natural parts of aquatic ecosystems, and according to the
                    <a href="https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/problem">
                        EPA
                    </a>,
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    “[Nitrogen and Phosphorus] support the growth of algae and aquatic plants, which provide
                    food and habitat for fish, shellfish and smaller organisms that live
                    in water… <br> Too much nitrogen and phosphorus in the water causes algae
                    to grow faster than ecosystems can handle. Significant increases in algae
                    harm water quality, food resources and habitats, and <strong>decrease the oxygen
                    that fish and other aquatic life need to survive</strong>. Large growths of algae
                    are called <strong>algal blooms</strong> and they can <strong>severely reduce or eliminate oxygen
                    in the water, leading to illnesses in fish and the death of large numbers
                    of fish</strong>. Some algal blooms are <strong>harmful to humans</strong> because they produce elevated
                    toxins and bacterial growth that <strong>can make people sick if they come into contact
                    with polluted water, consume tainted fish or shellfish, or drink contaminated water.</strong>”
                    (emphasis added)
                </blockquote>
                <p> Lakes are valued as water sources and for fishing, water transport, recreation, and tourism, so we can see
                     that more than just an ecosystem is at risk when our lakes become contaminated.

                    According to the <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/environment/air-land-water/water/waterquality/wqgs-wqos/approved-wqgs/nitrogen-overview.pdf"> Water Quality Guidelines for Nitrogen (Nitrate, Nitrite,
                    and Ammonia) by Water Stewardship Division Ministry of Environment Province
                    of British Columbia </a>, with respect to nitrate (as N), the <strong> average concentration
                    to protect freshwater aquatic life</strong> is <strong>3000 ug/L</strong> (micrograms per liter). For nitrate (as N), the 30-day average
                    <strong>concentration to protect marine aquatic life</strong> is <strong>3700 ug/L</strong>. The concentrations of total nitrogen,
                    which includes nitrate, nitrite, and ammonia (the maximums for the latter two are not listed in
                    our consideration) for the most polluted states in terms of their lakes' water quality on average are:
                    <ul>
                        <li> North Dakota: 3,866 ug/L</li>
                        <li> South Dakota: 4,015 ug/L</li>
                        <li> Nebraska: 4,681 ug/L</li>
                    </ul>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-6">
                <p class="placeholder">We can see that <em>each of these states has an average total nitrogen level per
                    lake much greater than the noted average concentration to protect freshwater aquatic life</em>, and
                    also <em>greater than the suggested concentration to protect marine aquatic life</em>. As we noted before,
                    this contributes to algal bloom, which has the potential to starve the marine life of nutrients
                    and even oxygen, causing fish kills and bacterial growth in the water that can make humans very sick.
                <br>
                    From our choropleth map detailing average state pollutant levels across three measurable pollutants,
                    we gleaned that the state of Nebraska was clearly not at a satisfactory level, especially in terms
                    of the nitrogen concentration and turbidity. The states of North Dakota and South Dakota also had
                    very high levels of pollutants relative to other states, and these three states far outweigh the
                    rest in terms of need for change as of 2007.

                    <h2>Something clever to segue into Nebraska</h2>
                    <p class="">From <a href="http://netnebraska.org/article/news/water-woes-widespread-across-nebraska">this article</a>, published by NET News in 2013,
                    we gain the follwing insights into progression of the situation in the midwest with respect to water quality:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Park managers in Nebraska began using “expensive chemicals”around 2007 to combat invasive species, in the form of aerial spraying. The spraying began in 2007, and continued at least until the writing of this article.
                        </li>
                        <li>Dan Lyle, a helicopter pilot and aerial sprayer in the area on restrictions on using the chemicals around municipal water sources - “That’s just as a safety factor to be sure that there’s no additional chemical in their water. It’s not that it’s not safe. It’s just that they do that to try and hedge on the safe side.”
                        </li>
                        <li>It was estimated at that time that more than $1 million per year would be allocated for this spraying to take place and combat the invasive plant species. The species are said to “choke” the water of its nutrients
                        </li>
                        <li>In another nearby Nebraskan city, Hastings, the city faces water pollution from a different source: <strong>over-application of nitrogen fertilizer</strong>. Marty Stange, environmental supervisor for Hastings Utilities, said <strong>plumes of groundwater with nitrate concentrations above federal limits will reach the city’s drinking water wells in about two years.</strong> </li>
                        <li>There are a number of Nebraskan problems for which the article claims that money is the solution:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Aerial spraying, $1 million a year
                                </li>
                                <li>Treat all the water in the state, $100 million</li>
                                <li> Aquifer storage restoration system, $46 million</li>
                                <li>Replacing the 2,800 miles of old cast iron water pipe in Omaha, $25 million</li>
                                <li>Rock Creek irrigation system, $130 million</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <p class="placeholder">
                    Senator Tom Carlson of Nebraska (unquoted) “said projects like those are good for complying with the interstate compact. But Carlson said they don’t necessarily help Nebraska reach water sustainability. He defines that as on average, across the state, not using more water than the supply provides. Carlson suggests sustainability requires a timetable for reducing water use. Not everyone agrees. Jasper Fanning, manager of southwest Nebraska’s Upper Republican Natural Resources District, said people should use less water. But Fanning doesn’t like the idea of a timetable. “I think choosing an arbitrary timeline for that is somewhat reckless, because you impose an economic cost, and you don’t know what technologies are going to come,” Fanning said.”
