                    <p>

                    “[Nitrogen and Phosphorus] support the growth of algae and aquatic plants, which provide
                    food and habitat for fish, shellfish and smaller organisms that live
                    in water… <br> Too much nitrogen and phosphorus in the water causes algae
                    to grow faster than ecosystems can handle. Significant increases in algae
                    harm water quality, food resources and habitats, and <strong>decrease the oxygen
                    that fish and other aquatic life need to survive</strong>. Large growths of algae
                    are called <strong>algal blooms</strong> and they can <strong>severely reduce or eliminate oxygen
                    in the water, leading to illnesses in fish and the death of large numbers
                    of fish</strong>. Some algal blooms are <strong>harmful to humans</strong> because they produce elevated
                    toxins and bacterial growth that <strong>can make people sick if they come into contact
                    with polluted water, consume tainted fish or shellfish, or drink contaminated water.</strong>”

                <p> Lakes are valued as water sources and for fishing, water transport, recreation, and tourism, so we can see
                     that more than just an ecosystem is at risk when our lakes become contaminated.

                    According to the <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/environment/air-land-water/water/waterquality/wqgs-wqos/approved-wqgs/nitrogen-overview.pdf"> Water Quality Guidelines for Nitrogen (Nitrate, Nitrite,
                    and Ammonia) by Water Stewardship Division Ministry of Environment Province

                    to protect freshwater aquatic life</strong> is <strong>3000 ug/L</strong> (micrograms per liter). For nitrate (as N), the 30-day average
                    <strong>concentration to protect marine aquatic life</strong> is <strong>3700 ug/L</strong>. The concentrations of total nitrogen,

                <p class="story-text">In viewing the first choropleth map, we found that there was a major pollution problem in lakes in the midwest in 2007, but did not have data from the lakes over the last decade to trace those pollution levels over time. After visualizing and understanding these findings, we found a more comprehensive data set and found that there are lots of bodies of water across the country that are impaired, threatened, or are not being monitored at all. This presented us with the question, if we have tangible, accurate data showing the real, adverse effects of pollution on these bodies of water, is it enough to make a significant change?

                Although there are many places where a large amount of work needs to be done, there are some
                places in which remediation work has already started. Chesapeake Bay has been a major area of
                concern for many years. According to the EPA, “Nitrogen and phosphorus have always been a part of
                the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem, but have increased to excessive levels over the last few decades.
                Prior to substantial human activity in the region, most nitrogen and phosphorus was absorbed or
                retained by natural forest and wetland vegetation. However, the activities of over 13.6 million
                people in the watershed have overwhelmed the Chesapeake Bay with excess amounts of nutrients.”

                Luckily, there has been a push for change.  The Chesapeake Bay is the largest estuary in the <br>
                United States, and as such, it needs to be protected from any anthropogenic harm.  In recent years, <br>
                there have been initiatives to lower the concentrations of the nutrients back to healthy levels. <br>
                In 2009, President Barack Obama signed an Executive Order forcing there to be more stringent laws <br>
                and remediation activities surrounding the bay.  This action along with subsequent efforts has <br>
                caused significant improvement for the estuary. <br><br>
                Chesapeake Bay spans several states, including Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and New Jersey.
                There are currently goals to reduce nutrient levels by 2025.
